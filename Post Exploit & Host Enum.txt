#####What are we trying to accomplish doing host enumeration?
#Gathering information about the environment in order  to escalate privileges, gather more information about the network, learn the habits of an admin is he a baddie.. There was times during ops you had to actually fix their own network for them in order to complete a task

When checking directories remember to always use ls -la. You never know what can be hiding.

####### Linux Commands basic 
date & time        = Are we on the right box ? knowing date and time for possible persistence 
Whoami         = double check who we are logged in as
Id                 = permissions group ( do we have root permissions)
Groups         = see what groups we are apart of (are we in the sudoers )
sudo -l                = do we have any binaries that execute with higher privs  
cat /etc/passwd         ( user information)
cat /etc/shadow         ( user information) ( need privileged access)
W  = who is logged in, terminal and what they are doing ( tty  are direct connections to the pc.. So pts are ssh or telnet connections (possible info about other pcs)
Last = information about users that logged in ( user habits ) ( might need to avoid times)
Uptime = how long has the machine been up ( would this make for a good pivot)
Hostname = name of machine ( pay attention)

uname -a         = kernel information architecture ( for exploits )
cat /etc/*rel* 

###########Networking Information

Ifconfig -a = network information ( verify your on the right target so you don’t go to jail pimp) ( dbo with the size 15 show)
cat /etc/hosts = translates hostnames or domain names to ip addresses ( could see a name to another box )
cat /etc/resolv.conf = configure dns name servers 
netstat -rn
netstat -antup  ( backdoors and rootkits do use magic packets and udp) ( the devil 514 port) programs on different ports we could exploit
arp -an         = sends data will verify arp cache ( only lasts for a few minutes) passive network enumeration .. Maybe we could find out information about other machines on the network without scanning



##############Process Information

ps -auxf         = (a) all processes,  format
Ps -aux | grep syslog* ( just cause it’s running doesn’t mean it’s remotely sending logs)
lsof -p 886         = list of open files ( files opened by the process w/ pid 886 ) ( root access can see everything the process is accessing)
lsof -i <4|6> = view files utilizing ip version 
ls -al /proc/886
ls -al /proc/886/fd  = file descriptors ( which is important, last thing we want is tools stolen)
sudo service --status-all          =show if services are running or not, based on the plus or minus


Note tha kernel-level processes have brackets around the name. For this course, honestly, those aren't very useful.

############ Logging

You always want to check what's going on in the directory of interest, and in your /etc or /var logs

Cat /etc/rsyslog.conf  = check for remote logging udp port 514 ( can get us caught)
/etc/rsyslog.d                 = directory where config files are kept we want to check those also.
/var/log                =  auth logs, etc
Cat /var/log/auth.log | grep -i successul


################ Crontabs
Crontabs are owned by respective users so you will not be able to see other users crontabs
*Note: Linux crontabs are equivalent to the "Run" registry keys in Windows.
/var/spool/cron/crontabs ( same as crontab -e just without syntax help)
/etc/cron.d
Ls -la /etc/cron* --> lists hourly, daily, weekly, monthly cronjobs
sudo crontab -u student -l

############### Finding files and locations to check

find / -name password* 2>/dev/null   ( pay attention to file extensions ): finds every file with password in the name somewhere
find / -type f -name *.txt         = (possible user generated documents )
find / -type f 2>/dev/null | grep filenamehere
find / -type f -name ".*"   = find all hidden files
find / -type d -name ".*"    = find all hidden directories

/tmp                check tmp folders. By default, if you need to dump files to a Linux machine, just send them to /tmp to sidestep permissions errors.
/home                 check home folders for users
/etc = config files are here ( can give you a hint if any extra programs have been installed on the box)

TCP Dump
tcpdump -X -A not port ## ←- your ssh connection port


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% WINDOWS COMMANDS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

############ General Information
Date /t
Time /t
Hostname
Whoami
systeminfo

############ User Information
Net user <optional user name> --> with no name, it lists all users. With a name, it gives stats about the users info.
Net localgroup <optional group name>
*Note: when adding new users, you'll need to add them to administrators and Remote Desktop Users localgroups
Net localgroup administrators
Net use ( if any shares are mapped)


######## Network Information
* Whenverv you RDP, go on "This PC" in File Explorer, and check that hidden documents are visible under the "View" tab..
Ipconfig /all
Ipconfig /displaydns --> shows the DNS table for recent domain name resolutions
Route print --> shows routing table, default gateway, etc.
Netstat -ant (lists open TCP port
Netstat -anob ( need to be admin; lists service and PID associated with each socket.)

############## Interesting Locations
Explorer - view - hidden items ( turn on show hidden items )
Check users documents,downloads,desktops
Dir c:\windows\prefetch ( admin ) = see what executables have been ran
Dir /a:h --> Looks for hidden ficd les and folders
dir /o:d /t:w c:\windows\system32 --> the /o:d means descending order,/t:w means timefield:lastWritten
dir /o:d /t:w c:\windows\system32\winevt\logs --> all logs are stored in an evtx file. Based on the date of the evtx files, you can see which logs arcome actually logging
dir /o:d /t:w c:\windows\temp
reg query hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /s   (don’t forget about hkcu) and runonce

###########Process and Services 
Tasklist /v --> gives verbose task information: task status, pid, parent PID, user
Tasklist /svc
tasklist /svc | findstr /i "PID"

Services.msc ( gui ). Look at the Description for things that aren't native.
The following command will show executables installed. You can see which ones aren't default.
for /f "tokens=2 delims='='" %a in ('wmic service list full^|find /i "pathname"^|find /i /v "system32"') do @echo %a
Sc query <service name>

Schtasks
Task sch ( gui )
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
schtasks /query
