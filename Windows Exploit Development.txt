#### Mona/Immunity Debugger
Create a cyclic pattern of 100 characters
        !mona pc 100

Run program and input cyclic pattern

Look at the IP to find what characters overwrote it and determine the offset to the IP:
        !mona po <paste eip>

Look at dlls/etc that this program needs:
        !mona modules

Look for a jump esp and record that address to be used in the exploit builder script:
        !mona jmp -r esp -m <modulename AKA dll>
		
		
		
################# Op notes:
When looking to exploit Buffer overflow, first thing to do is feed in a large input to see where the vulnerability takes place.
Generate a pattern as shown above, copy and paste the output into the executable input.
Look in the Immunity "Registers" to check for the EIP offset (8 bytes)
Go to the bottom bar and type mona po <EIP offset>
Run it again, and you'll see a message in the log data that a pattern was found in cyclic pattern at the offset position # (is also saved in a text file as "pattern")
** Note anytime the program crashes, you have to go to Debug > Restart in immunity
Now you wanna inspect the modules to check for dlls being run by the executable. Look for modules without memory protection so that we can find the jmp statement
jump to the ESP instruction in the dll associated with the executable and cut out any bad characters:
mona jmp -r esp -m libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll -cpb '\x00' (this says "Don't pull back any registers with a null byte"
--> this will output any thing into jmp.txt in the Immunity Debugger folder
or you could run mona find -s '\xff\xe4" (this is an alternate way of finding jmp esp)

How do you find out what your bad characters are?
-Use a Monda byte array by doing "mona bytearray".
-In the folder, this will return bytearray.txt
-Now run a mona compare -f "C:\Program files (x86)\Immunity Inc\Immunity Debugger\bytearray.txt"
This will open up a compare.txt. In compare.txt, there will be a line that says "possiblely bad characters"
Now keep scrolling down until you get to your DLL of interest (the one without any memory protections, libgcc)
If you don't find any matches in there, then that means there aren't any bad characters in your dll of interest
