I have an IP, what now?

1. Scan it
	1a. Find the ports/services running:	
		-See active host ports nc -nuzw1 172.20.20.45 1-1023
		-view one port in detail: nc 172.20.20.45 23
		-			
	1b. connect to the ports and see if there are any hints or flags: curl, wget -r
	1c. download said hints or flags, or view them: find / -name "flag*" 2>/dev/null

2. Connect to it
	2a. what device am I on?
	2b. what files of interest are there, if any?
	2c. what interfaces and IP's does this device have?: ip addr, ip neigh, uname -a, ip route
	
3. Determine what other devices that devices can communicate with
	3a. additional subnets
	3b. is it doing any NATing?

4. Move past it and pivot further into the network
	4a. is it a remote or local tunnel?
	- LOCAL (a single port, one-to-one):
	- ssh pivot@pivotip -L localport:targetip:targetport -NT
	- wget localhost:localport, curl localhost:localport, wget -r ftp://ip

	- REMOTE
	- (from insider) ssh -p altport_option IH@10.10.0.40 -R IHport:localhost:22 -NT
	- (options: from IH, doing dynamic forwarding from insider): ssh -D 9050 insider@localhost -p IHport
		--- Now use proxychains for any remaining functions
	- (options: from IH, set up a single local port fwd on IHport2 from insider to target @ targport) ssh insider@localhost -p IHport -L IHport2:target:targport -NT
		--- You can only view stuff on targs targport 2 using: curl localhost:IHport2 or wget -r localhost:IHport2

	- DYNAMIC
	- ssh -D 9050 pivot@pivotfloatingIP -NT

	- REMOTE PORT BINDING W/ PIVOT
	- (set it up: tunnel directly to insider from IH): ssh -p 7777 net2_student29@10.50.20.73 -L 29901:10.2.2.7:23 -NT
	- (from IH: set up tunnel to telnet in): telnet localhost 29901
	- (on Insider: set up remote SSH (insider 2222) back to the pivot (pivot alt 7777): ssh -p 7777 net2_student29@10.2.2.6 -R 22902:localhost:2222 -NT
	- (Back on IH; create tunnel to newly created remote link between insider & pivot (29902): ssh -p 7777 net2_student29@10.50.20.73 -L 22903:localhost:22902 -NT
	- (options: from insider, do a dynamic port scan from insider's perspective, on port 22903): ssh -D 9050 net2_student29@localhost -p 22903 -NT

		- (from insider) ssh pivot@pivotinternalIP -R pivotlocalport:localhost:22 -NT
		- (from IH) ssh pivot@pivotfloatingIP -L IHlocalport:localhost:pivotlocalport -NT
		- (options: from IH, doing dynamic PF from insider) ssh -D 9050 insider@localhost -p IHlocalport -NT
		- (options: from IH, make another local PF from internal IHlocalport2 to targ2 on targport) ssh targ2@localhost -p IHlocalport -L IHport2:targ2:targport -NT
		-	- To do any curl or wget, make sure to use localhost:IHport2

	4b. do I need to use telnet or ssh?
		- telnet IP
	4c. do I need to close a dynamic tunnel or set up a new one?
		- to close a tunnel: ps -elf | grep 9050 (look for first pid after "student/root")
		-kill using: kill -9 <pid>
		- to see all ports currently in use: netstat -antp
